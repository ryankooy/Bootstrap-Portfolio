            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="#" title="">
            <p>Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, and raised in the Piedmont of North Carolina, I am a product of Northern families and Southern-fried friends. Although the visual and audial arts and natural sciences have found the dominant favor in my mind's eyes and ears, a long-term attention deficiency has led me through educational pursuits in the healthcare, culinary, and managerial fields.
            <br>
                Underlying this amalgamation of sincere interests, distractions and diversions, a steady admiration for and competency in computing has stirred within me. With great opportunity looming before me, and with a fervor newly stoked, I intend to construct an everlasting, ever-growing monster of meaningful pursuit.
